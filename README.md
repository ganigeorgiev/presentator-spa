## Installing

> The prebuilt package located in `dist/` is meant to be used with [presentator/starter](https://github.com/presentator/presentator-starter).
> If you want to customize the default configurations and build your own version of the application, please follow the steps below.

1. Download or clone the project repo.

2. Create a new `.env.local` file in the project root directory. Copy and edit the configuration settings from `.env` to suit your environment setup.

3. Run the appropriate console commands:

```bash
# installs dependencies
npm install

# starts a dev server with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# generates i18n-report.json file with info about the current i18n app state
npm run i18n:report

# generates production ready bundle in dist/ directory
npm run build
```

> Built files are meant to be served over an HTTP server. Opening index.html over file:// won't work.
